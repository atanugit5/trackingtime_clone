# stoic-sack-3017
Hello there, I and my teammates would like to introduce you to the website we have cloned as a part of unit 5 construct week at Masai School.  

We have cloned trackingtime.co, it is a platform that provides the business with an efficient way to manage time which in turn enables them to manage their projects and improve productivity. Timetracking.co also acts as a platform that connects the user to multiple project management and time tracking software.

Glimpses of our website.

1)	<b>Home page.</b>

The home page begins with the navigation bar that enables the user to visit different pages that we have built. It also provides the gateway to the login page.  Post successful login the user will be able to see his/her name on the navigation bar along with a logout button.

The homepage also has various elements wherein the user can see some features, time tracking products, etc.

At the very bottom of the page, we have a footer section with various fields that will allow the user to explore our website.

2)	<b>Login and Signup.</b>

When the user visits the login page he can start by entering his/her email id and correct password to log in. 

If he/she is not a registered user he/she can register by simply clicking on the Signup link provided below the login button.

On signing up the email and entered password is stored in the backend. 

The user can revisit the login page by clicking on the “back to login link”.  

On entering the correct email and password the user is verified on the backend and if successfully logged in he/she will be routed to the home page.

3)	<b>Project management and timecards page.</b>

The project management page tells the user why he/she should prefer trackingtome.co to manage their projects. 

The use of images and the arrangement of various elements on the pages make the page very attractive.
Tracking time also provides the business houses with a time card facility that will enable them to track how an employee is utilizing his/her time.

Again here on this page, we have made very good use of CSS to make the page attractive and visually pleasing.

4)	<b>Integrations page.</b>

![Upload remote image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*4cC117hF0qctqi9B0m_4Cg.png)

The integrations page displays a wide range of time-tracking software that are available in the market. 

That data is fetched from the backend developed by us. From this wide variety of products, the user can search for a specific tool with the help of the search bar. 

To get a search result we have used regex in the backend while designing the API. 

Upon clicking on any particular tool the user will be redirected to an integration page that will provide a video description of that particular product and all the necessary descriptions associated with that product.

5)	<b>Blog page.</b>

![Upload remote image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*HT2f-19meZAg4tfeZk9Q7Q.png)

The blog page displays an entire list of the blogs that are available for the user to read. 

Here also we have used the backend to store and get the data. 

Another feature of the blog page is the use of an additional navigation section which allows the users to switch between various blog categories. 

This navigation will indicate the current category the user is looking at with the help of a green underline. 

On clicking various categories the user can see an entirely different set of data.
